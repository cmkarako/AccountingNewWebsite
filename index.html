			<h3>Meet our CPA!</h3>
			<h2>From soloentrepreneurs just starting out to property management companies overseeing 17 million in rental revenue, 
				Maurilio is ready to serve your needs. As a licensed CPA, 
				Maurilio has deep accounting knowledge and large scale accounting experience. </h2>
			<br />
			<p>Maurilio received his degree in Accounting from TCU and completed Masters level
				courses at University of Texas at Dallas. As he completed the CPA
				exams, Maurilio worked as an Accountant for The Medve Group, a property management company with
				multi-family communities spanning six states. <br/> <br/> From there he took a position as Senior Staff Accountant
				at McLane Company, a food distribution company running $50 billion in gross revenue. As he grew in his career and skills, 
				Maurilio made a move to K Hovnanian homes where he managed large scale accounting operations. </p>
			<br />
			<p>During this time, he helped a local Fort Worth business clean up their books and his passion to serve
				small businesses was born. He started laying the foundation for his own business and MC Accounting and
				Bookkeeping, LLC was formally established in 2019! </p>
			<br />
			<p>Maurilio strives to provide the greatest service to his clients and stay on top of the accounting
				industry trends and regulations. From State and Local Tax Compliance to closing journal entries and
				other period reports, Maurilio's experience has culminated in the ability to dive deep into the
				accounting of businesses of various sizes across several industries. </p>
